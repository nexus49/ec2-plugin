	Set the buffer price difference you want to have when requesting an instance. 
	The bid price will be calculated by using the current price for that instance type/region at the time of request plus the specified buffer.
	If the current price plus buffer exceeds the specified Spot Max Bid price, the max bid price will be used. 
	Your instance will run as long as your bid exceeds the current Spot Price for the instance type.
